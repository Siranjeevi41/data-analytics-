* Input Sequence: This represents the input data fed into the RNN, which could be in the form of text, time series data, or any other sequential data.
* Output Sequence: This represents the desired output from the RNN, which could also be a sequence (e.g., text generation, time series forecasting).
* Preprocessing: Preprocessing steps are applied to the input data to prepare it for feeding into the RNN. This may include tokenization, encoding, normalization, or any other necessary transformations.
* RNN Model: The RNN model processes the preprocessed input sequence to learn the underlying patterns and dependencies in the data. This could be a simple RNN, LSTM, GRU, or any other variant of the RNN architecture.
* Postprocessing: Postprocessing steps are applied to the output of the RNN to transform it into the desired format. This could involve decoding, denormalization, or any other necessary transformations.
* Evaluation & Interpretation: The output of the RNN is evaluated using metrics such as loss, accuracy, or any other relevant metrics. The performance of the model is analyzed and interpreted through visualization and analysis of the results.
