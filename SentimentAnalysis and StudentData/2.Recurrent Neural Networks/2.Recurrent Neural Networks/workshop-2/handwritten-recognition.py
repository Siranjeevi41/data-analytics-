"""
Design:

Data Preparation:
    Collect a dataset of handwritten characters or digits. You can use existing datasets like MNIST or create your own dataset.
    Preprocess the images by resizing them to a fixed size and converting them to grayscale if necessary.

Model Architecture:
    Define an RNN architecture for sequence modeling. You can use LSTM or GRU cells as the recurrent units.
    The input to the RNN will be sequences of pen stroke data representing each handwritten character.
    Use a softmax layer to output probabilities over the set of possible characters.

Training:
    Train the RNN model using the collected dataset.
    Use a loss function such as categorical cross-entropy to measure the difference between predicted and true labels.
    Use backpropagation through time (BPTT) to update the weights of the RNN.

Evaluation:
    Evaluate the trained model on a separate test set to measure its performance.
    Calculate metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score to assess the model's performance.

Inference:
    Use the trained model to recognize handwritten characters in new input data.
    Preprocess the input data (e.g., resize, convert to grayscale) and feed it into the RNN model.
    Decode the output probabilities to obtain the predicted characters.
