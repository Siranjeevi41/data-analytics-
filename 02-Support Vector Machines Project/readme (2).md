## Support Vector Machines (SVM)


### What?
* Support Vector Machines (SVM) are a type of supervised machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. 

### When to use?
* SVMs are particularly effective in high-dimensional spaces and are well-suited for scenarios where the data points are not linearly separable.


### Working 
* Linear Separation: The primary goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that best separates the data into different classes. In a two-dimensional space, this hyperplane is a line; in a three-dimensional space, it's a plane; and in higher dimensions, it's a hyperplane.

### Vector
* Support Vectors: These are the data points that are closest to the hyperplane and have the maximum margin. The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the nearest data point of either class. SVM aims to maximize this margin to improve the generalization performance of the model.

### Key Terms

```
Kernel Trick: SVMs can efficiently handle non-linear decision boundaries by mapping the input features into a higher-dimensional space using a kernel function. Common kernel functions include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid. The choice of the kernel depends on the characteristics of the data.

C Parameter: The C parameter controls the trade-off between having a smooth decision boundary and classifying training points correctly. A smaller C value leads to a smoother decision boundary but may misclassify some training points, while a larger C value aims to classify all training points correctly but might result in a more complex decision boundary.

Margin: The margin is the distance between the hyperplane and the support vectors. SVM aims to maximize this margin to improve the robustness of the model.

Soft Margin SVM: In cases where the data is not perfectly separable, a soft margin SVM allows for some misclassification. The C parameter regulates the penalty for misclassifying data points, and the goal is to find the right balance between maximizing the margin and minimizing misclassification.

Multi-Class Classification: SVMs can be extended to handle multi-class classification using methods such as one-vs-one or one-vs-all.

Regression: SVM can also be used for regression tasks by predicting a continuous output instead of a categorical label.

Here's a brief explanation of each step:

    Load Data: Load the dataset that will be used for training and testing the SVM model.

    Preprocess Data: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps such as handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, or text vectorization.

    Split Data: Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate the model's performance.

    Standardize (if necessary): Standardize or normalize the features if needed, especially for SVMs with certain kernels that are sensitive to scale.

    Choose Kernel: Select an appropriate kernel for the SVM model. Common choices include linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid kernels.

    Hyperparameter Tuning: Tune hyperparameters such as regularization parameter (C), kernel-specific parameters, and others to optimize the model.

    Train SVM: Train the SVM model on the training data using the chosen kernel and hyperparameters.

    Make Predictions: Use the trained SVM model to make predictions on the testing data or new, unseen data.

    Evaluate Performance: Assess the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, or mean squared error, depending on the task (classification or regression).

    Display Results: Display or visualize the results, which may include confusion matrices, ROC curves, or regression plots.

    End: End the flowchart.
